## Event vs a command
command + cron avoids the "fire an alert every time a listing event happens" spam problem entirely, and the dedup logic falls out naturally rather than needing separate anti-spam bookkeeping



## Running Saved search alerts

Run `php artisan alerts:send` to check all saved searches for newly-live
matching listings and notify users (currently logs a digest per user —
see the command's docblock for the production notification design).

This is intended to run on a schedule, not on-demand — in production it
would be wired up via a cron job (or Laravel's scheduler) to run once a
day around midday, e.g.:

    0 12 * * *  cd /path-to-app && php artisan alerts:send

Scheduling isn't configured in this exercise; run the command manually
to see it work.
